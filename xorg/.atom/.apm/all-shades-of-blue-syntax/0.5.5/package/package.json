In particular it:\n\n* Indents lists, gives list indicators a blue hue, and differentiates list text color from body text color;\n* Uses a light font weight;\n* Bolds headings; and\n* presents a blue-on-blue font/background combination for block quote elements.\n\nThis style _mostly_ adheres to my preferences for writing, but there are more changes I want to make (especially after I write with this theme for a while). Currently, I've only looked at this for Markdown; I'll work on other syntaxes as I need to. But it was difficult to find a Markdown-based syntax theme that worked for me, so this is an attempt to solve the problem in a way that best meets my needs and preferences.\n\n> \"and your heart's a thousand colors / but they're [all shades of blue](http://gregoryalanisakov.com/songs/all-shades-of-blue)\"\n\n## Screenshot of theme:\n\n![A screenshot of theme theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timlockridge/all-shades-of-blue-syntax/master/screenshot.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/timlockridge/all-shades-of-blue-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/timlockridge/all-shades-of-blue-syntax#readme","_id":"all-shades-of-blue-syntax@0.5.5","_shasum":"a344c10b5f26a0c237af9b1cec65bcc8c54d27c3","_resolved":"file:../d-11743-10594-w0k4gz.da81fko6r/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11743-10594-w0k4gz.da81fko6r/package.tgz"}
